# Open Source Club Documentation

OSC is the Open Source Club at the University of Florida. We are a community of makers, who want to solve problems and improve our world using open source projects. We were founded in the Spring of 2016 as an official student organization at UF. The club is also a partnered Special Interest Group of the UF ACM chapter.

Each semester, members meet and collaborate to build open source projects. Their documentation can be found here. For the main site, see: https://www.ufosc.org
